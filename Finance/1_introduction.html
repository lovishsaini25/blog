                    <p style="font-family:verdana">Before starting with valuation, I have a question.
                    <br><br><b>Is Mathematics a Science or Art? </b>
                    <br>
                    Yes, it is a science because it can be proven by empirical evidence. Mathematic is absolute, and two plus three will always be five whether you are counting from the left hand, right hand or through a computer or at north or south pole. There is nothing like maybe five or could be five or might be five; it is always five. The essence of science is that if you get the input right, you will get the output right. The laws of mathematics are universal, with no exceptions.</p>

                    <p style="font-family:verdana"></p>

                    <p style="font-family:verdana">So, can valuation be a Science? Let's suppose you find an undervalued company, and it might be a company where you know more than anybody else in the world, and you put in a great deal of information and thought into those inputs.
                    How evident it is that your output is going to be right? There is zero chance of it being right because you are not God and don't control the future; there are things that are out of your control.
</p>

                    <p style="font-family:verdana">A valuation can never be a science; hence the question arises, is valuation an Art? Before this let me ask you, is painting an Art? Yes. What makes Picasso so unique? Picasso can't get the nose at the right place, but Picasso's painting is worth a hundred million for some people. The essence of art is you can teach parts of art, but you can not be taught ultimately. Each Artist has their own way that makes them unique. In art, there are elements that can be taught, but there is also a magic that you either have, or you do not.
                    Valuation is not an Art, and it can be learned or taught. So, if it is not Science or Art, what is valuation?</p>

                    <p style="font-family:verdana">Valuation is a craft. The analogy that is closest to valuation is cooking. How do we master cooking? You could watch the food network or Master Chief or read every cookbook on the face of the earth, but you can not cook a meal. To learn how to cook, you would have to go into the kitchen to cook, and you know what happens when you cook for the first time? Fire Alarms go off. I remember the first time I scrambled eggs and made an omelette; nobody told me I was supposed to spray the pan. Pan and eggs go to the trash, but I learnt a fundamental lesson that you learn cooking by cooking.
                    </p>

                    <!-- <h2 class="section-heading"></h2> -->

                    <p style="font-family:verdana">Similarly, you learn valuation not by watching other people talk about it. So, no book by themselves will help you learn valuation, they might assist you with fundamentals, but you learn valuation by doing. The more you do it, the better you get at it. You will learn about different industries, geographies and what not. You will know what the troubles and issues are in Africa compared to the US or Europe.</p>

                    <p style="font-family:verdana">We need to make our hands dirty valuing diverse companies and study public companies, private companies, US companies, emerging market's companies. No matter what kind of business it is but we should be able to value the company. Often, we tend to price the company rather than valuing it. Pricing means what other people are willing to pay for the company. You go and buy a house, but ever wonder how the realtor came up with the price? Did they do an intrinsic valuation of the home? Maybe they do a DCF (discounted cash flow)? Not really!! They just looked at other houses in the neighbourhood, and they say that's what people are willing to pay for 3BHK in the locality, and that's what you have to pay.</p>

                    <!-- <blockquote></blockquote> -->

                    <p style="font-family:verdana">Some investments can only be priced, and to value something, you need cash flows. You can value a stock, bond, business or rental property because they all have cashflows. But you can't value Picasso's painting since there are no cash flows; therefore, you can only price them based on what other people pay. Similarly, you can not value a currency, but you can price it against other currencies. Gold, collectables fine art are all examples of investment with pricing. I would argue that most people who claim to be valuing things are actually pricing them (including stock target recommendations).</p>

                    <!-- <h2 class="section-heading"></h2> -->

                    <p style="font-family:verdana">There is another type of investment that is the option pricing model or valuing assets with contingent cashflows. Let's suppose there is a young pharmaceutical company that is working on a covid vaccine. This vaccine is a single shot with 100% effectiveness, but it is working its way through the pipeline, and it's not been approved yet. If that drug gets approved, it is worth billions, but if it doesn't get approved because of a side effect, the company could be worth nothing, and that's the option you are buying. <br>Think of an oil extracting company that found a lot of oil reserves, but many of these reserves are under rocks, under oceans, and that would take them 50$ per barrel to extract. If oil prices go to 35$, that company would not be worth anything. But that would be a mistake; they are worth nothing at today's oil price, but there is a contingency if the oil price goes to 85$ per barrel. There is an option here that is undeveloped natural resources. <br> There is also an option in platforms. Think of a company with a hundred million users on its platform that might not be making much money in terms of revenue. It may be losing money, but people talk about the valuable platform. But somehow, you find a way to take those hundred million users and generate profit from them, maybe by selling different stuff. You have not thought of it yet, but that's an option value. So, if you are invested in Twitter, it's because it has 300 million users and even though they have not figured out what to do in terms of monetizing these users and making money yet. Maybe they find a way to do it, and you could get value; there's an option in Twitter.</p>

                    <p style="font-family:verdana">There is always a gap between valuing an asset and pricing that asset. What drives the value of an asset is cash flows, growth and risk. The discounted Cash Flow model manifests that concept which brings cash flows, risk and growth into one equation. Price is driven by demand and supply, and what drives demand and supply? May be cash flows, growth and risk, but nothing changed fundamentally overnight. It could be mood or momentum or could even be an act of revenge against the company's competitor.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-family:verdana">Valuation is a bridge between numbers and storytelling. Let's say Airbnb, and you are expecting 50B$ revenue after ten years, but how? In most scenarios, people say it will have 40% growth in the first year or 30% CAGR in 10 years. But, we must have a story along with numbers. Airbnb is a booking company, or management is good so they can grow to 50B$ revenue. Every number in your valuation has to have a story attached to it, and every story you tell about its management or exceptional employee has to show up as a number. Just playing around with numbers or equations and not having a story behind it, you would realize that you could value anything, but you will not have faith.</p>

                    <p style="font-family:verdana">Consider a company you wanted to be in your portfolio, and you value the company at 50$ per share whereas the stock is trading at 30$. To buy the shares of that company, you need faith in two things. First, you need faith in your value for that company since you made these assumptions and came up with a valuation. You might know all the mechanics, but you need faith in the valuation. To make money, what has to happen? The price of that stock has to go to value; you have to believe (faith) that the market will correct its mistake. If you ask Priest to prove that God exists, he would have no answer but will ask to have faith that God exists. The essence of faith is that you can not prove it. Discount cash flow valuation is a lot of work; can you give shreds of evidence that if I do it, I will make money? No, we can not prove that whatever we do is correct, but you need to have faith that valuation is accurate and people will correct the price in the future. Faith is something you have to accumulate from within from your experiences. There will be times when you expect the price to go to valuation, but it soars, and that's when your faith is shaken. For some, faith is shaken, and for some, faith is broken; that is part of the market.</p>
